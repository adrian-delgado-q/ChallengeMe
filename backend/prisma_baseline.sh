# PRISMA & SUPABASE BASELINE SCRIPT
# ==============================================================================
# This script automates the process of resetting the local Prisma migration
# state and creating a clean, accurate baseline from an existing Supabase
# database.
#
# It is designed to fix "Drift detected" errors that occur when Prisma's
# migration history does not match the actual state of the Supabase DB.
#
# Run this from the root of your project.
# ==============================================================================

# Exit immediately if any command fails

# --- STEP 1: CLEAN UP ---
echo "STEP 1: Cleaning up previous Prisma state (deleting migrations and schema.prisma)..."

# --- STEP 3: INTROSPECT THE DATABASE ---
echo "STEP 3: Introspecting the database with 'prisma db pull'. This may take a moment..."

echo "âœ… Database introspected. Your 'prisma/schema.prisma' file is now a complete reflection of your database."
